Summary
The DriverPass project was a system design assignment for a fictional client named DriverPass—a company focused on helping students better prepare for their driving license exams. The client wanted a system that could handle online course registration, practice tests, lesson scheduling, and user account management. The solution also needed to support multiple roles, including customers, secretaries, and administrators, and connect with DMV systems to stay current with driving rules and requirements.

What I Did Well
I’m particularly proud of how I translated the client's business needs into a set of well-structured UML diagrams, including use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams. I also communicated technical details effectively through the client-facing presentation using nontechnical language, which is a crucial skill in real-world system design.

What I Would Revise
If I had to revise one part of the project, I would improve the UML Class Diagram by adding more detailed method definitions and refining relationships to reflect more precise data handling logic. This would better support implementation handoff to a development team.

User Needs Interpretation
To interpret user needs, I carefully reviewed the interview transcript and business requirements, identifying functional requirements like scheduling lessons and taking online tests. I prioritized clarity and user roles in the system design to make sure each use case addressed real user actions. Considering user needs is vital because it ensures the system actually solves the intended problems and delivers a smooth, intuitive experience.

My Approach to Software Design
My approach to designing software starts with user-centered analysis, followed by iterative modeling using UML, and clearly documenting both functional and nonfunctional requirements. In future projects, I’ll continue using strategies like process modeling and object modeling, and I plan to incorporate user story mapping and wireframing earlier in the process to further align designs with user expectations.
